      <h1><stong>Welcome to Code School</strong></h1><br>
      <h4>These are some of the languages this school has to offer</h4><br>
      <h2>Track 1</h2>
        <ul>
          <h5><strong>Javascript</strong></h5>
            <p>often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.
            </p><br>
          <h5><strong>C#</strong></h5>
            <p>is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p><br>
          <h5><strong>Java</strong></h5>
            <p>is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
        </ul><br>
      <h2>Track 2</h2>
        <ul>
          <h5><strong>Python</strong></h5>
            <p> is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,[25][26] notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[27]</p><br>
          <h5><strong>Ruby</strong></h5>
            <p>A lot of languages are object-oriented, but they still have the primitive data type. Theyâ€™ll have mostly everything as an object, but still with exceptions for integers or maybe characters or something. In Ruby, absolutely everything is an object, meaning everything operates in the same paradigm of sending and receiving messages.</p><br>
          <h5><strong>Javascript</strong></h5>
            <p>often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
